# VLF Metal Detector Project

## Overview
This project involves a handheld VLF (Very Low Frequency) metal detector capable of detecting and distinguishing between metals like iron, copper, and aluminum up to 16 cm deep. Designed for practical use in security, mining, and landmine detection, it operates at 5.5 kHz and uses an ATMega microcontroller for real-time metal identification displayed on an LCD.

## Features
- **VLF Technology**: Stable frequency operation at 5.5 kHz
- **Custom-Coiled System**: Transmitter, receiver, and feedback coils to minimize interference
- **Microcontroller-Based Analysis**: Processes amplitude and phase shifts for metal type identification
- **Practical Design**: Designed with Altium Designer (PCB) and SolidWorks (Enclosure)

## Technical Specs
- **Coils**: Transmitter (85 turns, 8 cm), Receiver (275 turns, 4 cm), with feedback coil
- **Circuitry**: Includes Wien Bridge Oscillator, amplitude, and phase detection circuits
- **Power Supply**: Powered by 3.7V Li-Po batteries regulated to 7V

## Testing
- **Simulation**: Verified in EveryCircuit for waveform analysis
- **Prototyping**: Breadboard testing with oscilloscope and multimeter measurements
